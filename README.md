# Environmental Inequities and Social Justice in Alameda

This project was for my seminar class in Spring 2021, Analytic and Research Methods for Planners: Introduction to GIS and City Planning (City Planning 204C).

This class is a graduate seminar in City Planning, focusing on the development of spatial models, raster- and vector-based analysis, constrained vector line networks, to 3D analysis. This class uses ArcGIS Desktop and ArcScene.

The class culminated in a final project that synthesizes the information covered throughout the semester. Along with two other classmates, Reshmi Prasad and Sara Ann Knutson, we explore the impact on environmental and social inequities on climate change emergenies in Alameda County. 

Specifically, we ask: what is the relationship between high environmental risks associated with flooding and vulnerable populations? We address this question by providing a vulnerability analysis of environmental and social factors related to flooding in order to determine which current populations and spaces in Alameda County appear to be the most vulnerable to the effects of flooding.

After creating a network model from topologically sound streets, we devised the following research plan:
